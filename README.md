This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Description

This is a multi-choice quiz where the user is presented with a series of questions where each question has a number of possible answers and one answer is correct.

You can create any number of quizes and each quiz can have any number of questions.  Normally, each question would have three or four possible answers.  Questions in a quiz are shuffled randomly, and the answers for each question are also shuffled randomly.

The data is held in a Quiz array (located in quiz.service.ts) and a Question array (located in questions.service.ts)

The text for the questions and the text for the correct answers can be displayed on multiple lines by using the \n character.
